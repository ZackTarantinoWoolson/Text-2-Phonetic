# Phonetic Alphabet Text Translator Extension

This Extension is a simple text replacement / Translator tool I created to help quickly spell out words to others. I often find myself reading out links, GUIDs, or emails in my job and my mind goes blank when trying to find a word for each letter. So, I made this tool!
